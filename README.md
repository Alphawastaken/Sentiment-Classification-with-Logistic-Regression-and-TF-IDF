# Sentiment Classification with Logistic Regression and TF-IDF

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook implementing **sentiment analysis** on a Twitter dataset using **TF-IDF vectorization** and **Logistic Regression**.

## ðŸ“– Project Description
The notebook explores traditional machine learning for sentiment classification.  
Key features:
- Custom text preprocessing (emoji handling, contractions, negation, punctuation normalization, etc.)
- TF-IDF feature extraction with tuned hyperparameters
- Logistic Regression classifier
- Accuracy evaluation on validation and test sets
